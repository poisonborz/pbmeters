There are many [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) skins. This one is mine.
Very simplistically styled, displaying some important stats for your PC and network, slapped with weather and some shortcuts.

It's one single skin, so resolution and dpi-changes between machines do not cause alignment issues.
As a rather unique feature amongst RM skins, it auto-detects your location (based on IP address) for weather.
You can use the 'size' variable to scale the whole skin.

GPU metrics are based on [TGonZo](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?t=21449)'s skin and need per-gpu configuration - or you can remove these meters.

If you'd like a Calendar also, there's a matching Rainlendar [Calendar skin](http://www.rainlendar.net/cms/index.php?option=com_kunena&Itemid=42&func=view&catid=2&id=25528#25528).

**Beware with those IP addresses when screenshotting.**
