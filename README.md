There are many [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) skins. This one is mine.
It has a low-key minimal style, displaying some important stats for your PC and network, slapped with weather and some shortcuts.

It's one single skin, so resolution and dpi-changes between machines do not cause alignment issues.
As a rather unique feature amongst RM skins, it auto-detects your location (based on IP address) for weather.
You can use the 'size' variable to scale the whole skin.

### Installation
To install, copy it in its own folder in RM's Skins folder, and load it through the application.

Temps are in Celsius, remove `&unit=m` from both url-s for F-s.
The GPU meters need per-gpu configuration - more on this in the link below, or you can remove these meters.
Adjust the MeasureNetOut/MeasureNetIn maxvalues to typical speeds of your region.

### Notes
GPU metrics are based on [TGonZo](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?t=21449)'s skin.

If you'd also like a neat Calendar, there's a matching [Rainlendar skin](http://www.rainlendar.net/cms/index.php?option=com_kunena&Itemid=42&func=view&catid=2&id=25528#25528).

**Beware with those IP addresses when screenshotting.**
